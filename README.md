### Netflix Movies and TV Shows Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Netflix is an American subscription streaming service and production company. Launched in 1997, it offers a library of films and television series through distribution deals as well as its own productions. Netflix has and still takes the world by strom. As of year 2020, the company generates dozens of billions in revenue, and listed 115th place on the Fortune 500.  So, when a database comprised of thousands of titles appers, data analysts must take a close look and play with it. Particularly, this exploratory data analysis project will cover everything from understanding the database, cleaning it, processing some of its values, analyzing trends, and finally visualizing everything. I will break each section and provide explanations on thoughts and desired actions.
